Day 1: July 5th, 2018
Today's Progress: I've moved from 75% to 85% done with Codecademy's introductory Python course. I finished up sections on list/dictionary manipulation and also bitwise operations. I'm now a bit over halfway through the Classes section, which is a welcome step up in complexity. I should be able to finish this course within the week, maybe tomorrow if I work at it.
Thoughts: I'm finally in the Classes segment of a coding course, so you know I'm getting up there. One particularly interesting section of code they had me write was this bitwise operation method:

# This method flips a specified bit in a given number.
def flip_bit(number, n): 
  mask = 0b1 << (n-1) 
  result = mask ^ number 
  return bin(result)
