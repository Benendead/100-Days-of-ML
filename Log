Day 1: July 5th, 2018
Today's Progress: I've moved from 75% to 85% done with Codecademy's introductory Python course. I finished up sections on
list/dictionary manipulation and also bitwise operations. I'm now a bit over halfway through the Classes section, which is a
welcome step up in complexity. I should be able to finish this course within the week, maybe tomorrow if I work at it.
Thoughts: I'm finally in the Classes segment of a coding course, so you know I'm getting up there. One particularly
interesting section of code they had me write was this bitwise operation method:

# This method flips a specified bit in a given number.
def flip_bit(number, n): 
  mask = 0b1 << (n-1) 
  result = mask ^ number 
  return bin(result)
  
Day 2: July 6, 2018 (1 hour extra so far)
Today's Progress: I finished the Codecademy Python course this morning and then spent the rest of that first hour beginning
a linear algebra book. Tonight, in a second hour of work, I began reading Learning From Data before realizing that a more 
rigorous background in linear algebra is needed, and so I've now began the UTAustinX Linear Algebra - Foundations to 
Frontiers course on edX. My goal is to complete that course, supplifmented by the mentioned workbook, and then see how far I
can comprehend Learning From Data. Added note: I'm on 0.2.4 of the edX course, as it doesn't save my progress on its own.
Thoughts: It's frusturating to constantly need a more robust background in whatever math area is next, but I hope that by 
cracking down and working hard I can truly gain understanding of these fundamentals so that my ML endeavors are a breeze.
