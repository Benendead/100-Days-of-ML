# 100-Days-of-ML
The rules are simple:
100 days. 1 hour per day of ML-related studying.

Research and then create solutions to problems using machine learning.
So far, it's been mostly learning about the field, but that's still a start.

NOTE: These first 50 days were only kind of a success, so I've decided that having passed Day 50 I'd start a new document.
